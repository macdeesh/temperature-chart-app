## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

### Performance Standards

- **60fps maintained** during all transitions and view switches
- **Quick data table rendering** - table should load within 1 second for 5000 rows
- **Smooth animations** - all transitions should feel natural and responsive
- **Memory efficient** - table view shouldn't duplicate data unnecessarily

### Code Quality

- **Component reusability** - shared loading components across features
- **Type safety** - proper TypeScript interfaces for new features
- **Error handling** - graceful failures with user-friendly messages
- **Testing** - validate performance with maximum data size (5000 rows)
