# Temperature Chart App V1.1 - Bug Fixes & Core Improvements

## 🎯 Version Overview

**Focus:** Bug fixes, core functionality improvements, and essential UX enhancements
**Target:** Maintain smooth 60fps performance while fixing critical issues
**File Size Limit:** Increase from 1000 to 5000 rows maximum

---

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Fix "Jump to Time" Functionality

**Issue:** Chart jumps to correct time but wrong temperature view (Y-axis positioning)
**Expected Behavior:** When jumping to specific time, maintain proper temperature range view
**Implementation:**

- Fix zoom/pan logic to preserve Y-axis bounds when navigating to time
- Ensure temperature view shows relevant data around the target time
- Test with various zoom levels and data ranges

### 2. Fix Chart Scaling Issues

**Problem:** Inconsistent and illogical axis scaling during zoom operations

#### Temperature Scale (Y-Axis) Fixes

- **Default state:** 50°C intervals (clean whole numbers)
- **Zoom progression:** 50° → 25° → 10° → 5° (maximum zoom)
- **No decimals:** Always show whole temperature values (25°C, 30°C, 35°C)
- **No weird numbers:** Eliminate displays like "403.4°C, 408.4°C"
- **Apply to full range:** -100°C to 1400°C with intelligent scaling

#### Time Scale (X-Axis) Fixes

**Current Problem:** Illogical time intervals (10:38, 10:54, 10:56 - inconsistent gaps)

**Required Solution:**

- **Default (no zoom):** Logical time intervals with consistent spacing
  - Choose appropriate interval based on total time span
  - Examples: 10-minute intervals (10:30, 10:40, 10:50) or 5-minute intervals
- **Zoom progression:** 10min → 5min → 2min → 1min → 30s → 20s → 10s (maximum zoom)
- **Grid lines only:** Show time grid lines without interpolating fake data points
- **No repeated times:** Eliminate displays like "10:56, 10:56, 10:56"

**Implementation Details:**

```javascript
// Time interval calculation based on visible range
const calculateTimeInterval = (timeSpan) => {
  if (timeSpan > 120) return 20; // 20min intervals for >2 hours
  if (timeSpan > 60) return 10; // 10min intervals for 1-2 hours
  if (timeSpan > 30) return 5; // 5min intervals for 30-60min
  if (timeSpan > 10) return 2; // 2min intervals for 10-30min
  if (timeSpan > 5) return 1; // 1min intervals for 5-10min
  if (timeSpan > 2) return 0.5; // 30s intervals for 2-5min
  return 0.33; // 20s intervals for <2min (max zoom)
};
```

## 🔧 Core Improvements

### 3. Increase File Size Limit

**Change:** Update maximum supported rows from 1000 to 5000
**Location:** `src/lib/csvParser.ts`
**Update:**

```javascript
const MAX_ROWS = 5000; // Updated from 1000
```

**Error Message:** Update to "File too large. Maximum supported rows: 5000"

### 4. Add Company Logo Functionality

**Feature:** Allow users to upload and display company logo
**Requirements:**

- Display App logo in sidebar
- Displayed as first item, with dropdown option to change it with user logo
- Support common formats: PNG, JPG, SVG
- Save logo preference in session files
- Default fallback of App logo when no logo is set

### 5. Replace PNG Export with PDF Export

**Change:** Replace current PNG chart export with PDF generation
**Requirements:**

- Generate PDF with chart at high resolution
- Include company logo in PDF header or footer
- Maintain chart quality and readability
- Professional PDF layout with proper margins
- File naming: `temperature_chart_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm.pdf`

### 6. Enable Channel Renaming

**Feature:** Allow users to rename channels from default CH1, CH2, etc.
**Requirements:**

- Double-click or edit button on channel labels
- Save custom names in session files (.tdproj)
- Validation: prevent empty names, character limits
- Reset to default option
- Updated names appear in tooltips, legends, and exports
